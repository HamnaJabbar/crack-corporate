DSA:

1. Suppose there is an array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Find the largest and second largest number in this array with O(n) complexity.
2. Suppose there is a 2D array that always remain square (meaning rows == columns). Find the sum of it’s both diagonals.
   [[1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ],
[ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ],
[ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ],
[ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7]]
   Make sure the time complexity is O(n)
